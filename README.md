# bike_rental_oop

The bike rental project uses object oriented design to simulate a bike rental stand. 

bike.py contains the class definition of various types of bikes a person can rent (regular bike, child bike, tandem bike). 

people.py contains the class definition of a person including identifying information and the ability to pay for and receive a bike. 

rental_station.py contains the class definition for the rental station. This includes the current inventory of each bike type, pricing, revenue, and the ability to rent out bikes.

test_rental_station.py contains the test code used to test the bike.py, people.py and rental_station.py prior to running the complete simulation. main.py contains the simulation of the bike rental.
